# Story
## General Description
Welcome to your platformer kitchen. You are a chef gifted with elemental powers and you must leverage these powers to cook. Each level is a new kitchen and presents a new customer. You must figure out how to cook the ingredients on the screen using your elemental power, place them on one plate, and deliver it to the customer. A properly cooked order helps you receive a higher level score. Any burned ingredients or undercooked ingredients will negatively impact your score for that level.

Your elemental powers not only cook, but they also aid in traversal. Use your powers to reach platforms that would otherwise be out of reach. 

## Logline 
A cooking experience in a platformer format that leverages the power of natural elements.

## Goal
Use the power of your elements to traverse the level, prepare ingredients, and deliver the correct order to the customer to complete the level. Your goal is to complete levels as quickly as possible! Your level score is determined by the accuracy of the order you deliver as well as the speed of level completion.
